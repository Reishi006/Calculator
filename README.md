# Calculator

This project is basically just an exercise for learning some more Javascript. I made it following a youtube video and added some functions of a Windows 10 calculator.
I decided to add it to the github profile to get to know how to work with repositories and so on.

Also it's WIP, so some things might added later as I work on the code.
